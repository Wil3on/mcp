# FPS Monitor

This Node.js application monitors log files for FPS data and exposes an API endpoint to retrieve the latest and average FPS values.

## Features

- Automatically finds and monitors the latest directory in the logs folder
- Extracts FPS values from console.log files
- Calculates average FPS
- Provides an API endpoint to retrieve FPS data
- Configurable via config.json

## Project Overview

The FPS Monitor is designed to help developers and server administrators track the performance of their Arma Reforger servers by monitoring FPS data in real-time. It provides a simple API and a monitoring dashboard for easy visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Configuration

You can configure the application by editing the `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "logDir": "logs",          // Directory containing log folders
  "logFileName": "console.log", // Name of the log file to monitor
  "updateInterval": 5000,    // How often to check for new data (in milliseconds)
  "port": 3000               // Port for the API server
}
```

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the API endpoint:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:3000/api/fps
   ```

## Frontend Monitoring Dashboard

The application includes a simple monitoring dashboard accessible at the root URL (`http://localhost:3000/`). This dashboard visualizes FPS data in real-time, providing insights into server performance.

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory specified in the `config.json` file. Ensure the directory exists and is writable by the application.
